Both Information Extraction and Text Summarization are related to other language processing applications. For example, Information Retrieval systems return sets of relevant documents in response to a query; hopefully the answer is contained in the documents. Thus IR can be used to locate strings within fixed corpus windows, producing Summarization (and, in the limit, IE-like) results. This is true mostly for query-based Extract summaries.

IE is not the same as Question Answering by computer, because QA (usually) operates over databases and provides answers to specific queries, one at a time. It is clearly useful in QA applications, however.

Similarly, both Summarization and IE can fruitfully be linked to Machine Translation (MT; see Chapter 4) to perform multilingual information access. One can, for example, translate a document and then perform IE on it as a whole, or one can first perform IE on it and then just translate the parts that IE returns.

Despite such differences, it is becoming apparent that IE, QA, IR, Summarization, and MT form a complex of interrelated information access methods. In a typical application, IR may be performed before IE or summarization, to cut down text search; the database of templates that IE subsequently produces can then be searched with IR or QA, or can be summarized; the results can then be translated by MT. This ordering is not the only one, obviously, but reflects the relative speeds and costs of the different tasks.

Mere document retrieval is inadequate for our needs. Full text understanding does not yet exist. Information extraction and summarization occupy a middle ground, providing needed functionality while at the same time being computationally feasible.
